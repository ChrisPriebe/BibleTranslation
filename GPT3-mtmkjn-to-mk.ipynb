      "MRK 5:16 And those who had seen it gave them an account of him who was troubled by evil spirits and of the pigs.\n",
      "MRK 5:17 And they made their requests to be a guest of him in their rounds.\n",
      "MRK 5:18 And when he went to the boat, the man who had the evil spirits made a request to him to be with him.\n",

      "MRK 5:34 And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be made well from your disease.\n",
      "MRK 5:35 And while he was saying these words, there came from the Synagogue children, saying, Your daughter is dead; and why are you xowing to be turned to the Master?\n",
      "MRK 5:36 But Jesus, hearing the mouth, straight away said to the ruler of the Synagogue, Have no fear, only have faith.\n",
      "MRK 5:37 And he did not everyone go away from him but Axen, and Jesus, and John, the brother of Jesus.\n",
      "MRK 5:38 And he came to the Synagogue, where he saw an order, weeping, and great doping.\n",
      "MRK 5:39 And when he had gone in, he said to them, Why are you troubled and weeping? The child is not dead, but is sleeping.\n",
      "MRK 5:40 And they were laughing at him. But he, taking them all, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was.\n",
      "MRK 5:41 Taking the child, he said to her, Give yourself to my side: they were to say, Gent, I say to you, Get up.\n",
