    "## Why use encoding\n",
    "To get around this \"cheating\" we will create a new language.  For fun we are calling it \"birrig\" (for no reason).  It is a substitution cipher where we switch various letters for other letters, keeping the vowels and capitals and punctiation so it is somewhat readable.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So it should treat each word as an unknown and need to learn it as a new language.  In so doing we can simulate translating from English to birrig and then we have the cipher to see if it does the same.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The weaknesses however are:\n",
    " - it is word for word translation and not requiring it to be reworded to choose best word\n",
    " - it is grammatically the same so it doesn't account for mechanics like changing word order for empasis in some langauges or cases like brother (older) is different from brother (younger).\n",
